1) Silence's script updated (DisplayStringHead()'s). Now she starts her default pickpocketing only when the party
   is nearby.
2) bAR1105.baf, bRIBALD.baf modified for a better performance.
3) AR4286.baf restored (known undroppable items will be returned to their owners - for most NPCs).
   AR4361.baf - many Continue()'s added
   AR4330.baf - possible deadlock removed (necessary creatures couldn't be created and Hemp Rope couldn't be found)
   AR4219.baf - restored

   - CBBANED.BAF: Refers to DCLERIC, which doesn't have deathvar in BG2, CRE needs to be patched
        (that code commented - can't find any DCLERIC's relation to SoS content)
   - CBMAYOR2.BAF: Last line, CBSDSO06 should be CBSWDSOU  (KD - CBRSSOUB is right dialogue)

   - CB351GD3.D: ARCHER_CALL_SHOT should be SPCL121
   - CBAMNLGS.D: CBAMNL0[1-4] should be CBAMNLG[1-4]

*************************
v103: Changes from v101
-------------------------
1) Unused files removed. Download archive size reduced from 95.9M to 69M.

2) All AREs revised with DLTCEP, their file structure rearranged and fixed. Many missed infotriggers 
   and automap pointers text patching added, Beregost taverns ambients removed to reflect 
   Soubar environments.

3) Missed ambient sounds added (OGG3 directory); some missed scripts and BAMs reincluded.

4) Solved all possible area compatibility issues. AR4300 -> AR4370 with all corresponding resources, 
   script/dialogues links, TIS and WED fixed (there was a real MESS with it!)

5) All ITMs revised; numerous bugs fixed: 0 weapon proficiences, invalid or absent icons/BAMs,
   wrong stats, incomplete descriptions; total upgarde of usability settings. Now all items match 
   their descriptions.
   In a combination with BDash-WeiDU text fix all descriptions will be 99%-complete.

6) STOres revised and many incorrect rumors dialogues links fixed, strings patches added.

7) All dialogues revised: empty blocks removed, several invalid external references fixed.
   The whole bunch of dialogues is getting compiled by one COMPILE command now as it should be to produce
   valid crossreferences.

8) Scripts revised: several missed patches for journal entries added.

9) Patching of all BG2 original resources converted to "WeiDU-only" that makes it 100% compatible 
   with any other mod around.

10) Journal system revised and rearranged for a single .TRA using (both scripts and dialogues) to unify
    the journal strings for correct entries' adding/removing.

11) Several BG1-side strings fixed because of many SoS creatures use them in their soundsets. Patch is taken 
    from BGT-WeiDU.

12) Great main screen logo for SoS taken from Yovaneth's fixpack as well as some fixes checked and 
    implemented (except "G3 Identify All" one).
    For more info visit: http://www.final-exodus.net/~dai/yovaneth/baldursgate_index.html

13) Installation script (TP2 and BATs) optimized, some errors fixed (f.e. it biffed everything, 
    including AR0072.tis that should remain in \override\).

14) Unused WAVs removed from ALORA, KIVAN and ELDOTH soundsets. The creatures that use them 
    are not joinable NPCs, so they won't use any sound beside 01,03,07,11,17-19,38,39. 

15) Missed FLAMN and several other (for creatures soundsets) WAVs added.
